# Child-Development-Analysis

This project explores various factors influencing child development using a dataset of childrenâ€™s activities, preferences, and characteristics. The study focuses on variables such as communication methods, sleep habits, household size, and academic preferences to determine their influence on various developmental metrics.

## Analysis Overview

### Factor 1: Communication with Friends
- Assessed the relationship between communication modes and time spent hanging out with friends.
- Conducted a chi-square test to determine statistical significance.

### Factor 2: Dietary Preferences and Height

- Analyzed the height distribution by vegetarian status using boxplots.
- Performed a two-sample t-test to check for significant differences in mean height.

### Factor 3: Academic Preferences and Homework Hours

- Recoded favorite school subjects into broader categories.
- Used boxplots and ANOVA to analyze differences in homework hours based on academic preferences.
- Conducted pairwise comparisons to identify significant differences between subject groups.

### Factor 4: Sleep Hours and Household Occupants

- Examined the relationship between sleep hours on school nights and the number of household occupants.
- Conducted correlation analysis and linear regression to assess the strength and nature of the relationship.
- Evaluated residuals for model accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into how communication habits, dietary choices, academic preferences, and environmental factors impact child development. While some variables, such as academic preferences, show significant effects, others, like household size, appear to have minimal influence on the outcomes measured. These findings could inform future studies and interventions aimed at supporting child development.
